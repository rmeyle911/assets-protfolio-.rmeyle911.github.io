This is my github account. I have never used this before so I am an extreme beginner. I added my website files to this, 
I then made some changes. I edited the lang tag on the academics and home page. On the home page I edited the title name as well. 
I cloned the file, made and saved the changes, then pasted the files into the github desktop, I saved the summary/description, 
lastly I published the changes.
